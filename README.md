Mapping_Earthquakes

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

To complete this project we uses GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. With this information we added that data to a map visualization with layers and selectors.

To boild the visualization we used Leaflet library to build a Mapbox map through an API request. This plots have interactivity added for the earthquake data.
